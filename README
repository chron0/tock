TOCK

Tock is a feature-rich distributed cron/job queue.  It has the ability to spawn jobs on remote
servers using http requests, including a basic form of load balancing.  The remote server
will spawn the job, and stream the output back to the tock master process.  The remote server
also takes advantage of node.js native clustering, so it can take advantage of the machines' cores.

Included in the tock package is an admin UI and API for creating scheduled jobs, one-off jobs,
a dashboard for watching jobs in progress, and statistics about jobs.

Tock uses MongoDB as the internal storage mechanism for schedules, and job results.  The standard
out and standard error outputs are stored as files in gridFS.  Mongoose.js is used as the API
into MongoDB.
